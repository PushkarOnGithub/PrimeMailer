        <li style={{color: 'red'}}>Optimized Email Sending</li>
        <p>
        We understand the challenges of sending bulk emails, especially when dealing with limits imposed by email providers like Gmail. PrimeMailer has a smart solution to tackle this issue.

        PrimeMailer Send intelligently divides your email list into manageable segments, ensuring that you stay within the limits set by email service providers. For example, Gmail has a daily limit of 500 emails. PrimeMailer Send will automatically schedule your email campaign over multiple days, adhering to these limits while maintaining the effectiveness of your outreach.

        This feature not only ensures compliance with email service provider restrictions but also maximizes the deliverability and engagement of your emails. You can relax while PrimeMailer manages the logistics, allowing you to focus on your message and audience.
